**I built NoobTacoUI to give you a clean, consistent, and awesome-looking interface in World of Warcraft.**

It's a collection of high-quality fonts, sounds, and textures, plus it comes with all the settings you need to get your UI dialed in just right.

## ✨ What's Inside

### 🎨 A Better Looking UI

Keep everything looking consistent across your whole screen with built-in profile setup.

- **Pixel Perfect Scaling**: Built-in tools to set your UI scale perfectly for 4K, 1440p, and 1080p resolutions.
  - **Standard (1:1)**: Maximum screen real estate with mathematical sharpness.
  - **High Visibility (2:1)**: Doubled UI size for better accessibility while maintaining perfect clarity on high-DPI monitors.
- **Addon Profiles**: Guided, three-step setup for a perfect UI:
  - **Step 1: Mandatory Edit Mode**: One-click export of optimized layout strings.
  - **Step 2: Automated Application**: Apply all loaded addon profiles at once. You can now customize your bulk setup by toggling "Include in Bulk Setup" for specific addons.
  - **Full Addon Management**: Alphabetical list of all supported addons (BetterBlizzFrames, Platynator, XIV_Databar, etc.) with smart status badges (**NEW**, **UPDATE**, **UP TO DATE**, **NOT LOADED**) indicating if the NoobTacoUI profile is applied and current. Features include a **DOWNLOAD ADDON** button for missing requirements and a toggle to include/exclude the addon from bulk application.
- **Game Settings**: Direct control over critical CVars to ensure your UI looks crisp.
- **Global Font Replacement**: Complete control over your game's typography.
  - **Smart Replacement**: Automatically overrides system fonts with your chosen typeface.
  - **Granular Control**: Set different fonts for **Interface**, **Chat & Meter**, **Combat Text**, and **Quest Headers**.
  - **Consistent Look**: Forces sticky frames like Combat Text and Nameplates to match your theme.

### 📚 Extensive Media Library

All media is automatically registered with **LibSharedMedia-3.0** and available in any compatible addon.

- **Google Fonts**: A curated collection of fonts optimized for readability (Montserrat, Roboto, Lato, Dosis, Exo2, Mukta, Poppins).
- **NoobTaco Theme Textures**: 32 high-quality status bar textures (Solid and Gradient) based on the popular NoobTaco color palette.
