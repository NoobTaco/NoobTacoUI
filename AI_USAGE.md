# AI Usage & Development Ethics

## Our Stance on AI in Addon Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the current era of software development, AI tools have become a double-edged sword. While they offer speed, we are witnessing a rise in "rampant" AI-generated code—often referred to as **Vibe Coding**—where logic is generated without deep understanding, leading to bloated, inefficient, and potentially breaking addons.

I am firmly against this approach. Addons should be crafted with intent, especially when they interface with the World of Warcraft engine, where performance and reliability are paramount.

## How AI is Used in This Project

I use AI as a high-powered assistant, not a replacement for engineering. Its role in this repository is strictly limited to:

- **Documentation**: Enhancing READMEs and clarifying code comments for better user and developer understanding.
- **Boilerplate & Repetitive Tasks**: Automating mundane, low-risk syntax patterns (like localized string tables or simple table structures).
- **Proofreading**: Identifying potential typos or syntax errors before they reach the testing phase.

## My Commitment to You

Every single line of code in this repository is reviewed, tested, and validated by me personally. I do not ship code that I do not understand. My priority is to maintain the lean, high-performance standards expected of the **NoobTaco** name, ensuring that AI serves the addon, rather than the addon serving as a playground for unverified AI output.
